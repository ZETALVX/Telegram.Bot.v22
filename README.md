# Telegram.Bot.v22
A small tutorial to create a Telegram BOT with C# (v.22)

Video tutorial on my channel: https://youtu.be/L1nCIz8Q6LM

I have inserted two versions, one with only the chatbot function via the console.
And the other complete with everything as shown in my video, with integrated Telegram and TTS.

I used Visual Studio 2022. 
I used the "Telegram.Bot" and "HttpToSocks5Proxy" library. 
The version of Telegram.Bot used is the 22.3.0.
The version used of HttpToSocks5Proxy is 1.4.2. 

You can install both by going to: project, NuGet packets. Search and install both and use the latest version available.
